# FireCamp Swarm Internal

By default, docker swarm manager listens on ip:2377 with TLS enabled. And [the swarm manager tls files are not exposed for the external use](https://forums.docker.com/t/cannot-connect-to-cluster-created-with-swarm-mode/16826/7).

One solution is to start docker daemon with our own CA certificate. So the FireCamp manageserver could talk with the docker daemon on the Swarm manager nodes. While, this will not work on the existing swarm cluster created with the default TLS.

It looks better to run the FireCamp manageserver container on the Swarm manager nodes, and talk with Swarm manager via the unix socket. The customer could easily add FireCamp to the existing or new swarm cluster. The FireCamp manageserver container is very light. It is ok to run on the swarm manager node.

Docker swarm service could [pass the task slot in the volume source name](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/persistent-data-volumes/#use-a-unique-volume-per-task-using-ebs) to the volume plugin. So the volume plugin could directly know which member the container is for. This works for the single availability zone cluster. One EBS volume is binded to one availability zone. In the multi-zones cluster, Docker Swarm task slot is not aware of the availability zone.

# Create a FireCamp Swarm cluster

Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/jazzl0ver/firecamp/pkg/tree/master/docs/installation) to install the Swarm cluster using cloudformation.

# Install FireCamp on the existing Swarm cluster

If you already have the Swarm cluster and want to use FireCamp, you could follow below steps.

1. Create the FireCamp IAM and assign to all Swarm nodes.

Use packaging/aws-cloudformation/firecamp-iamprofile.template to create the IAM, and add this IAM to the node's IAM.

2. Decide the cluster name you want to assign to the Swarm cluster.

FireCamp assigns a unique DNS name for every service member. For example, the cluster name is c1, the service name is mymongo and has 3 members. FireCamp will assign mymongo-0.c1-firecamp.com, mymongo-1.c1-firecamp.com and mymongo-2.c1-firecamp.com to these 3 members.

The cluster name has to be unique for the swarm clusters in the same VPC. If 2 swarm clusters have the same name and creates the service with the same name as well, the members of these 2 services will have the same DNS name. This will mess up the service membership. Different VPCs will have different DNS servers, different HostedZone in AWS Route53. So the swarm clusters in different VPCs could have the same name.

3. Add FireCamp tag to each node, tag key: firecamp-worker, value: clustername.

4. Add the availability zone labels to docker engine at every node.

The availability zone labels are required to run the service on part of the availability zones in one cluster. If all availability zones will be included in the service, could skip this step. For example, your swarm cluster has 3 availability zones and you plan to create a 3 or more replicas stateful service such as ZooKeeper.

For example, on the 3 availability zones cluster, Redis may be deployed to 1 or 2 availability zones. Deploying to 1 availability zone might be fine for some applications that use Redis only for cache. Redis cluster mode supports 1 slave for 1 master. The customer may deploy all masters on 1 availability zone, and deploy all slaves on the second availability zone to tolerate the availability zone failure.

If the cluster includes only 1 or 2 availability zones and Redis is deployed to all (1 or 2) availability zones, could also skip this step.

5. Install FireCamp plugin on every swarm worker node.

Create the FireCamp directory: `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/firecamp` and `sudo mkdir -p /var/log/firecamp`.

Install plugin for the release, such as release 0.9.x:
```
docker plugin install --grant-all-permissions jazzl0ver/firecamp-volume:0.9.x PLATFORM=swarm CLUSTER=c1
docker plugin install --grant-all-permissions jazzl0ver/firecamp-log:0.9.x CLUSTER=c1
```

6. Install FireCamp log plugin on every swarm manager node.

Create the FireCamp directory: `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/firecamp` and `sudo mkdir -p /var/log/firecamp`.

Install plugin for the release, such as release 0.9.x: `docker plugin install --grant-all-permissions jazzl0ver/firecamp-log:0.9.x CLUSTER=c1`.

7. Create the FireCamp manageserver service on the swarm manager node.

The example command for release 0.9.x:
`docker service create --name firecamp-manageserver --constraint node.role==manager --publish mode=host,target=27040,published=27040 --mount type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock --replicas 1 --log-driver=jazzl0ver/firecamp-log:0.9.x --log-opt ServiceUUID=firecamp --log-opt ServiceMember=manageserver -e CONTAINER_PLATFORM=swarm -e DB_TYPE=clouddb -e AVAILABILITY_ZONES=us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c -e CLUSTER=c1 jazzl0ver/firecamp-manageserver:0.9.x`

Please update the AVAILABILITY_ZONES, CLUSTER, the manageserver docker image tag and firecamp log plugin tag accordingly accordingly to your environment. Please do NOT change others.

8. Create the stateful service.

For example, to create a 2 replicas PostgreSQL, copy the firecamp-service-cli to the manager node and simply run: `firecamp-service-cli -cluster=c1 -op=create-service -service-name=pg1 -service-type=postgresql -replicas=2 -volume-size=1`
