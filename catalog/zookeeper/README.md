# FireCamp ZooKeeper Internals

The FireCamp ZooKeeper container is based on the [official ZooKeeper image](https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper/). The data volume will be mounted to the /data directory inside container. All ZooKeeper data will be stored under it.

## Topology

The ZooKeeper cluster should have at least 3 nodes across 3 availability zones. This could tolerate 1 node or 1 availability zone failure. It is suggested to have 5 nodes across 3 or more availability zones, to tolerate 2 nodes or 1 (or more if the cluster has more availability zones) availability zone failure.

## Security

By default, ZooKeeper could [control access using ACLs](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.10/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_ZooKeeperAccessControl).

The simple example steps:

1. Login with zkCli.sh: `zkCli.sh -server host`

2. Create a znode: `create /zk_test mydata`

3. Add a new user: `addauth digest user1:password1`

4. Set acl for the znode: `setAcl /zk_test auth:user1:password1:crdwa`

In the future, [SASL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZooKeeper+and+SASL) and [SSL](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/ZooKeeper+SSL+User+Guide) will be supported.

## Monitoring

FireCamp uses Telegraf to monitor ZooKeeper and send metrics to AWS CloudWatch. You could create a Telegraf service for the ZooKeeper Cluster. Then you can view the metrics and create dashboard on CloudWatch. For more details, refer to [FireCamp Telegraf](https://github.com/jazzl0ver/firecamp/pkg/tree/master/catalog/telegraf).

## JVM Configs

By default, the Java heap size is set to 4GB. If your ZooKeeper wants other memory, you could specify the "zk-heap-size" when creating the ZooKeeper service by the firecamp-service-cli.

**Set JVM TTL for ZooKeeper Java client**

By default, JVM caches a successful DNS lookup forever. ZooKeeper Java client should [set JVM TTL](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/java-dg-jvm-ttl.html) to a reasonable value such as 60 seconds. So when ZooKeeper container moves to another node, JVM could lookup the new address.

**JMX**

By default, JMX is enabled to collect ZooKeeper metrics. The JMX default listen port is 2191. You could specify the JMX user and password when creating the service. If you do not specify the JMX user and password, the default user is "jmxuser" and an UUID will be generated as the password.

ZooKeeper JMX port is used internally for ZooKeeper monitoring. The port is only accessible in the service security group that ZooKeeper cluster runs, and is not exposed to the application access security group.

## Update the Service

If you want to increase the JVM heap size or change jmx remote user/password, you could update ZooKeeper config via the cli. For example, to increase the JVM heap size, run `firecamp-service-cli -op=update-service -service-type=zookeeper -region=us-east-1 -cluster=t1 -service-name=myzoo -zk-heap-size=10240`. See the firecamp cli help for the detail options, `firecamp-service-cli -op=update-service -service-type=zookeeper --help`.

The config changes will only be effective after the service is restarted. You could run `firecamp-service-cli -op=restart-service -service-name=myzoo` to rolling restart the service members when the system is not busy.


## Logging

The ZooKeeper logs are sent to the Cloud Logs, such as AWS CloudWatch logs.


# Tutorials

This is a simple tutorial about how to create a ZooKeeper service and how to use it. This tutorial assumes the cluster name is "t1", the AWS Region is "us-east-1", and the ZooKeeper service name is "myzoo".

## Create a ZooKeeper service
Follow the [Installation](https://github.com/jazzl0ver/firecamp/pkg/tree/master/docs/installation) guide to create a 3 nodes cluster across 3 availability zones. Could create a ZooKeeper cluster by:
```
firecamp-service-cli -op=create-service -service-type=zookeeper -region=us-east-1 -cluster=t1 -service-name=myzoo -replicas=3 -volume-size=20 -zk-heap-size=4096
```

This creates a 3 replicas ZooKeeper on 3 availability zones. The default heap size is 4g. If you want to reduce it for test such as 256MB, set -zk-heap-size=256. Each replica has 20GB volume. The DNS names of the replicas would be: myzoo-0.t1-firecamp.com, myzoo-1.t1-firecamp.com, myzoo-2.t1-firecamp.com.

## Create znode, user and acl
1. Login with zkCli.sh: `zkCli.sh -server myzoo-0.t1-firecamp.com`

2. Create a znode: `create /zk_test mydata`

3. Add a new user: `addauth digest user1:password1`

4. Set acl for the znode: `setAcl /zk_test auth:user1:password1:crdwa`
